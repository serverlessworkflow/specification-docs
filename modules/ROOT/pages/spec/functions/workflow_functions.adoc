= Workflow Functions

Workflow xref:spec/structure/state_definitions/function.adoc[functions] are reusable definitions for service invocations and/or expression evaluation. They can be referenced by their domain-specific names inside workflow xref:spec/structure/states/workflow_states.adoc[states].

Reference the following sections to learn more about workflow functions:

- xref:spec/functions/expression.adoc[]
- xref:spec/functions/custom.adoc[]

We can define if functions are invoked sync or async. Reference the xref:spec/structure/state_definitions/functionref.adoc[functionRef] to learn more on how to do this.
