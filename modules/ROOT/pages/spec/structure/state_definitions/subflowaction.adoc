= Subflow Action

Often you want to group your workflows into small logical units that solve a particular business problem and can be reused in multiple other workflow definitions.

Reusable workflows are referenced by their `id` property via the SubFlow action `workflowId` parameter.

For the simple case, `subFlowRef` can be a string containing the `id` of the sub-workflow to invoke. If you want to specify other parameters then a xref:spec/structure/state_definitions/subflowref.adoc[subFlowRef] should be provided instead.

Each referenced workflow receives the SubFlow actions data as workflow data input.

Referenced sub-workflows must declare their own xref:spec/structure/state_definitions/function.adoc[function] and xref:spec/structure/state_definitions/event.adoc[event] definitions.
