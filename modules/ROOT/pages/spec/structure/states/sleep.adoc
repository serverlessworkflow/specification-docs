Sleep state suspends workflow execution for a given time duration. The delay is defined in its `duration` property using the ISO 8601 duration format.

The `timeouts` property allows you to define state-specific timeouts. It can be used to define the `stateExecTimeout`. For more information on workflow timeouts see the xref:spec/workflow_timeouts.adoc[Workflow Timeouts] section.
